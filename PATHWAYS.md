# Choose Your Path: How to Use This Guide

> "Not everyone learns the same way. Find your path below."

This guide works for different people with different goals. **Don't read it cover to cover** unless that's your style. Instead, find yourself below and follow the recommended path.

---

## 🎯 Quick Self-Assessment

**Answer these 3 questions to find your path:**

### 1. What's your coding experience?

**A) Complete Beginner**
- Never written code before
- Don't know what "front-end" or "API" means
- Intimidated by technical terms

**B) Dabbled Before**
- Tried tutorials but never finished a project
- Understand some concepts but can't build alone
- Know what HTML/CSS are but not much else

**C) Technical Non-Coder**

---

## 🗺️ Your Learning Path

### Path 1: Complete Beginner (A + any goal)

**If you answered A above, start here regardless of your goal:**

```
1. QUICK-START.md (5 min) ← Get context
2. Chapter 4: Tutorial (1 hour) ← Build something immediately
3. Chapter 1: Method (15 min) ← Now understand what you just did
4. Chapter 2: Apps (20 min) ← Understand the architecture
5. Chapter 5: Building Blocks ← Reference as needed
6. Chapter 6: Debugging ← When things break
7. Chapter 7: Testing ← Before showing anyone
8. Chapter 8: What's Next ← Where to go from here
```

**Why this order?** You need proof you can do this BEFORE learning theory. Building first gives you context for everything else.

**Time to first working app:** 1 hour (Chapter 4)

**Alternative if you're α (Hands-On First):**
- Do Chapter 4 first
- Skip everything else until you hit a problem
- Use other chapters as reference when stuck
- Read Chapter 8 when ready for next project

---

### Path 2: Dabbled Before (B + Goal 1 or 2)

**You've seen tutorials but never shipped. This path focuses on finishing:**

```
1. Chapter 1: Method (15 min) ← Understand the vibe coding approach
2. QUICK-START.md (5 min) ← Set up environment
3. Chapter 4: Tutorial (1 hour) ← Build end-to-end
4. Chapter 5: Building Blocks ← Reference when adding features
5. Chapter 7: Testing (20 min) ← Don't skip this
6. Chapter 6: Debugging ← Bookmark for when things break
7. Chapter 8: What's Next ← Plan your next build
```

**Skip:** Chapter 2 (you probably know this), Chapter 3 (use what tutorial uses)

**Why this order?** You have concepts but lack shipping experience. Focus on completing the tutorial, testing it, and deploying it. That's the skill you're missing.

**Time to deployed app:** 2 hours

---

### Path 3: Technical Non-Coder (C + Goal 2 or 4)

**You understand systems but haven't built. Fastest path to competence:**

```
1. Chapter 1: Method (10 min) ← Skim - you get it
2. Chapter 3: Choosing Stack (15 min) ← Understand decisions
3. Chapter 4: Tutorial (45 min) ← You'll move faster than beginners
4. Chapter 5: Building Blocks ← Deep dive - this is your reference bible
5. Chapter 6: Debugging ← You'll need this often
6. Chapter 8: What's Next ← Build your roadmap
```

**Skip:** Chapter 2 (you know this), Chapter 7 (you'll figure it out)

**Why this order?** You have architecture knowledge. Focus on translation between "what you want" and "how to describe it to AI." Chapter 5 is your most valuable resource.

**Time to competence:** 3 hours reading + practice

**Recommended:** Read Chapter 5 twice. First time: overview. Second time: deep reference.

---

### Path 4: Already Building with AI (D + any goal)

**You've built something but hit limits. Fill in your gaps:**

```
Start with your specific problem:

Stuck on authentication? → Chapter 5 (Authentication section)
Deployment failing? → Chapter 5 (Deployment section) + QUICK-START
Things breaking? → Chapter 6 (entire chapter)
Don't know if it's ready? → Chapter 7
Not sure what to build next? → Chapter 8
Want to understand architecture better? → Chapter 2
Choosing between frameworks? → Chapter 3
```

**Don't read sequentially.** Use this guide as a reference. Jump to what you need.

**When to read full chapters:**
- Chapter 6 (Debugging) - Read once, prevents hours of frustration
- Chapter 8 (What's Next) - Read when you finish your current project

**Time to solve specific problem:** 15-30 minutes

---

### Path 5: Want to Build Specific Project (Any experience + Goal 1)

**You have an idea. Here's the fastest path to live URL:**

```
1. QUICK-START.md (5 min) ← Environment setup
2. Chapter 4: Tutorial (1 hour) ← Learn the pattern
3. Modify tutorial to your idea:
   - Keep the structure (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel)
   - Change the feature (bookmarks → your idea)
   - Deploy when core feature works
4. Chapter 5: Building Blocks ← Add features as needed
5. Chapter 7: Testing (15 min) ← Before announcing
```

**Use as reference:**
- Chapter 6 when stuck
- Chapter 5 for adding payments, email, file uploads

**Skip:** Chapter 1-2 (learn later), Chapter 8 (read after launching)

**Why this order?** Your goal is shipping. Learn minimum viable knowledge, ship fast, learn the rest later.

**Time to deployed MVP:** 4-8 hours over a weekend

**Pro tip:** Don't add features until core workflow is deployed. Ship early, iterate publicly.

---

### Path 6: Want to Become Consistent Builder (C or D + Goal 4)

**You want to ship weekly/monthly. Build the foundation:**

```
Phase 1 (First Weekend):
1. Chapter 1: Method (15 min)
2. Chapter 4: Tutorial (1 hour)
3. Chapter 5: Building Blocks (1 hour) ← Study this
4. Ship the tutorial project

Phase 2 (Second Weekend):
1. Chapter 3: Choosing Stack (20 min)
2. Build micro-project with different stack
3. Chapter 6: Debugging (30 min)
4. Ship second project

Phase 3 (Third Weekend):
1. Chapter 8: What's Next (20 min)
2. Plan your building cadence
3. Set up templates from your first two projects
4. Ship third project (should take < 6 hours now)

Phase 4 (Ongoing):
- Reference Chapter 5 for new features
- Reference Chapter 6 when stuck
- Use Chapter 7 before each launch
- Reread Chapter 8 monthly for ideas
```

**Why this order?** Building consistency requires repetition. Ship three projects in three weeks. You'll learn patterns that make shipping fast.

**Time to consistent shipping:** 3 weeks

**Key skill:** By project 3, you should recognize patterns and reuse code. If not, slow down and study Chapter 5 more deeply.

---

## 📚 Learning Style Adaptations

### If you're α (Hands-On First)

**Your modified path (regardless of experience):**
```
1. Chapter 4 → Build immediately
2. Get stuck? → Jump to relevant section in Chapter 5 or 6
3. Finish project? → Skim Chapter 7, deploy anyway
4. Deployed? → Read Chapter 8 for next project
5. Want to go deeper? → Read Chapter 1-3 after shipping
```

**Your motto:** "I'll understand it after I've built it."

**Warning:** You'll ship faster but may rebuild things. That's okay. Speed > perfect understanding.

---

### If you're β (Comprehensive Top-Down)

**Your modified path (regardless of experience):**
```
1. README.md (10 min) ← Overview
2. Chapter 1: Method (15 min) ← Philosophy
3. Chapter 2: Apps (20 min) ← Architecture
4. Chapter 3: Stack (20 min) ← Decisions
5. GLOSSARY.md (10 min) ← Terminology
6. Chapter 4: Tutorial (1.5 hours) ← Now build with full context
7. Chapter 5-8 sequentially
```

**Your motto:** "I want to understand the system before I touch it."

**Warning:** You might over-learn before shipping. Force yourself to complete Chapter 4 even if you don't feel "ready."

---

### If you're γ (Just-In-Time Reference)

**Your modified path (regardless of experience):**
```
1. Bookmark this guide
2. Start with Chapter 4 only
3. When you need something:
   - Authentication? → Chapter 5, Authentication section
   - Broken? → Chapter 6, search for your error type
   - New feature? → Chapter 5, relevant building block
   - Ready to ship? → Chapter 7 checklist
```

**Your motto:** "I'll read it when I need it."

**Recommended bookmarks:**
- Chapter 5 (Building Blocks) - Most referenced
- Chapter 6 (Debugging Checklist) - For when stuck
- Chapter 7 (Testing Checklist) - Before launch

**Warning:** You might miss foundational concepts. If you're rebuilding the same mistakes, spend 30 min reading Chapter 1.
