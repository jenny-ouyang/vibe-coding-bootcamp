# Master Constraint Prompt
# Use this with EVERY AI coding request to prevent over-engineering

Copy and paste this at the end of every prompt to Cursor, Claude, or ChatGPT:

CODING CONSTRAINTS - FOLLOW THESE RULES:

BEFORE YOU CODE:
1. Summarize what you understand about the requirement
2. Ask specific questions about any uncertainties
3. List files you plan to modify and why
4. Get confirmation before proceeding

WHILE CODING:
1. Make ONLY the changes needed for the specific requirement
2. Do NOT add features, enhancements, or "improvements" not requested
3. Do NOT refactor or reorganize existing working code
4. If you modify the same file 3+ times, STOP and explain what you're trying to do

WHEN COMPLETE:
1. Verify the specific requirement works
2. Confirm existing functionality isn't broken
3. Stop working - do not continue "improving"

REMEMBER: Your job is to implement the specific request with minimal impact to existing code. Ask questions instead of making assumptions. Focus on working functionality, not perfect code.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE CONSTRAINTS? Confirm before starting any work.

# How to Use

EXAMPLE - Instead of:
"Add a login page"

DO THIS:
"Add a login page with email and password fields

CODING CONSTRAINTS - FOLLOW THESE RULES:

# Why This Works

Without constraints, AI will:
- Add features you didn't ask for
- Refactor working code "for consistency"
- Create multiple variations
- Keep "improving" endlessly

With constraints, AI will:
- Ask clarifying questions first
- Make minimal changes
- Stop when done
- Preserve existing functionality

This is the difference between shipping in days vs getting stuck in iteration loops.
