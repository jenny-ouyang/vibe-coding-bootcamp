# Templates & Resources

These templates remove friction from your building process. Copy-paste them as needed.

## What's Here

### 1. Pre-Flight Checklist (`pre-flight-checklist.txt`)
**Use before:** Starting Chapter 4 tutorial
**Purpose:** Verify all accounts and software are set up
**Time needed:** 40 minutes (one-time setup)

Complete this checklist before building your first app. It ensures you have everything needed to follow along without interruptions.

### 2. Environment Variables Template (`env-template.txt`)
**Use during:** Chapter 4, Step 7 (Adding Supabase)
**Purpose:** Proper format for `.env.local` file
**How to use:**
1. Copy entire content
2. Create new file named `.env.local` in your project root
3. Paste content
4. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials

### 3. Master Constraint Prompt (`master-constraint-prompt.txt`)
**Use with:** Every AI coding request
**Purpose:** Prevent AI from over-engineering and adding unwanted features
**How to use:** Copy and paste at the end of every prompt to Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT

## How to Reference These in the Guide

These templates are mentioned at specific points in the chapters where they're needed:

- **Chapter 4, Step 7:** "See `templates/env-template.txt` for the exact format"
- **Chapter 4, Before starting:** "Complete the pre-flight checklist in `templates/`"
- **Throughout:** "Use the master constraint prompt (see `templates/`) with every request"

## Why Only 3 Templates?

We intentionally kept this minimal because:
- ✅ Each template removes genuine friction
- ✅ None require understanding code
- ✅ All are immediately copy-pasteable
- ✅ They support the "one prompt" philosophy

We deliberately excluded:
- ❌ Code snippets (defeats the vibe coding approach)
- ❌ Multiple variations (creates decision paralysis)
- ❌ Architecture diagrams (too technical for beginners)
- ❌ Deployment checklists (already covered in Chapter 4)

## Attribution & Sharing

The Master Constraint Prompt is freely reusable with attribution to buildtolaunch.ai

Feel free to:
- Modify for your needs
- Share with your team
- Include in your own guides
- Adapt for different AI platforms

Just keep the attribution line intact.
