## The True $0 Path

You can genuinely start with ZERO dollars:
1. ✅ Claude/ChatGPT free tier (learning)
2. ✅ Cursor free tier (2,000 completions/month)
3. ✅ GitHub (always free)
4. ✅ Vercel/Netlify hosting (free tier)
5. ✅ Supabase (free tier: 500MB)
6. ✅ Free subdomain (yourapp.vercel.app)

**First purchase:** Domain name when you're ready to launch (~$12)
**Second purchase:** AI Assistant Pro when you hit free limits (~$20/month)

## Common Upgrade Triggers

### You'll Need to Pay When:
- **AI Assistant:** You hit daily message limits (2-3 weeks of daily use)
- **Cursor:** You exhaust 2,000 monthly completions (intensive building)
- **Supabase:** Database exceeds 500MB OR you need >2 projects
- **Vercel:** You exceed 100GB monthly bandwidth (rare for new apps)
- **Domain:** You want professional branding (yourapp.com vs yourapp.vercel.app)

### You Can Stay Free When:
- Learning and experimenting
- Building MVP (first version)
- Early testing with small user base (<100 users)
- Many apps remain on free tiers even with moderate success

## Add-On Service Pricing

### Email Services
**Resend (Recommended):**
- Free: 3,000 emails/month
- Pro: $20/month for 50,000 emails
- Scale: $90/month for 100,000 emails
- Cost per 1k emails at scale: $0.65

**SendGrid (Alternative):**
- Free: 100 emails/day (~3,000/month)
- Paid: Variable pricing, similar to Resend

### Payment Processing
**Stripe (Standard):**
- Domestic cards: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- International: 3.1% + $0.30 + 1.5% cross-border + 1% currency conversion
- ACH: 0.8% (capped at $5)
- Chargebacks: $15 per dispute
- No monthly fees or setup fees

**Example:** $100 sale = $2.90 + $0.30 = $3.20 fee (you receive $96.80)

### File Storage
**Included in Supabase:**
- Free tier: 1GB storage
- Pro tier: 100GB storage
- Usually sufficient; dedicated CDN rarely needed

## Notes on Pricing Volatility

### Stable Pricing (Unlikely to Change):
- Stripe transaction fees
- Domain registration costs
- GitHub (free tier commitment)

### May Increase in 2025:
- AI Assistant subscriptions (high demand)
- Cursor pricing (newer product, finding market rate)
- Infrastructure services (as AI apps consume more resources)

### Price Protection:
- Most services grandfather existing customers
- Annual plans lock in rates
- Free tiers rarely decrease (companies expand them)

### For Serious Builders:
Budget $40/month from day one (AI Assistant + Cursor Pro) to avoid friction.

### For Launched Products:
Expect $40-65/month until you have significant users (>1,000), then budget for infrastructure scaling.

### For Cost Optimization:
- Use free tiers as long as possible
- Upgrade only when hitting limits
- Start with free subdomain, add custom domain when validated
- Use Stripe (no monthly fees) over fixed-fee payment processors
- Monitor Supabase database size to avoid surprise upgrades
