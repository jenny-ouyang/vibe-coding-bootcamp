## 🎯 Decision Points

### Format Decision (You choose):
- **Option A:** Keep everything in GitHub, link to Gumroad for PDF
- **Option B:** GitHub for reading, Gumroad for downloads + email capture
- **Option C:** Both platforms, track which drives more traffic

**Recommendation:** Option B - GitHub for SEO/discovery, Gumroad for email list building

### Pricing Decision (You choose):
