### 3. Added Comprehensive Pricing Section

Created new "Complete Pricing Breakdown (Verified December 2024)" section that includes:

Detailed guide showing how to genuinely start with $0:
- Use all free tiers

- Clear guidance on when to upgrade

#### Realistic Monthly Costs
- Learning phase (Month 1-2): $0-20
- Building phase (Month 3-6): $20-40
- Launched with users (Month 6+): $40-65

#### Path-Specific Breakdowns
- Path 1 (Static Site): ~$12/year
- Path 2 (Web App): ~$12/year starting, ~$300-550/year with growth
- Path 3 (Python App): ~$60-135/year or ~$12/year with Oracle free tier

### 4. Updated Free Tier Information

**Path 1 (Static Site):**
- Clarified Netlify/Vercel free tiers cover most use cases
- Updated domain cost range to $10-15/year

**Path 2 (Web App):**
- Updated Supabase free tier: 500MB database, 2 active projects (not "50K monthly users")

**Path 3 (Python):**

### 5. Improved Cost Transparency

**Before:** Mixed tool costs with infrastructure costs, unclear what's needed to START vs RUN

**After:**
- Clear separation: "Tool Costs" (personal, one-time) vs "Infrastructure Costs" (per project)
- "Starting out" vs "With growth" breakdowns for each path
- Explicit free tier limits so readers know when they'll need to upgrade
- Timeline-based cost expectations (Month 1-2, 3-6, 6+)

### 6. Added "When to Upgrade" Guidance

Clear triggers for when to move from free to paid:
- AI Assistant: When you hit free tier limits (2-3 weeks of daily use)
- Cursor: When free completions run out (intensive building)
- Supabase: When you exceed 500MB or need more than 2 projects
- Domain: When you want professional branding
