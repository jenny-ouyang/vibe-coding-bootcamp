# Vibe Coding from Zero: Build AI Products Without Coding

> **Ship your first AI product in 7 days — no programming experience required**

⭐ **Free comprehensive guide** to building with AI assistance  
📚 **60+ pages** of step-by-step tutorials and frameworks  
🚀 **Battle-tested** by builders who shipped real products  
💡 **Created by Jenny Ouyang** | [Build to Launch Newsletter](https://buildtolaunch.substack.com)

## What You'll Learn

This guide teaches **domain experts with zero coding background** how to build and ship real web applications using AI tools like Claude and Cursor.

By the end, you'll be able to build:
- ✅ Web apps with user accounts and authentication
- ✅ Database-driven applications that store and retrieve data
- ✅ Payment-integrated products with Stripe
- ✅ Deployed applications with real URLs that anyone can access

**No prior programming experience needed.** If you can clearly describe what you want to build, AI can help you build it.

## Who This Is For

### Perfect for:
- 🎯 Domain experts with product ideas but no technical background
- 🧑‍🏫 Teachers, marketers, consultants, designers, creators who see problems software could solve
- 💼 Professionals who tried learning to code and bounced off the syntax
- 🚀 Entrepreneurs who can't afford $50k for an MVP but have valuable product ideas

### Not required:
- ❌ Computer science degree
- ❌ Previous programming experience  
- ❌ Understanding of how computers work
- ❌ Math skills beyond basic arithmetic

## What Makes This Different

Traditional coding courses teach you syntax, algorithms, and computer science theory. This guide teaches you **how to build products** by describing what you want while AI handles the implementation.

**Key insight:** The bottleneck isn't writing code anymore — it's knowing what to build and how to describe it clearly. That's where your domain expertise becomes your superpower.
