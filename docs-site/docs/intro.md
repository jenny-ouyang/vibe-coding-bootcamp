# Vibe Coding from Zero: Build AI Products Without Coding

> **Ship your first AI product in 7 days — no programming experience required**

⭐ **Free comprehensive guide** to building with AI assistance
📚 **60+ pages** of step-by-step tutorials and frameworks
🚀 **Battle-tested** by builders who shipped real products
💡 **Created by Jenny Ouyang** | [Build to Launch Newsletter](https://buildtolaunch.substack.com)

## What You'll Learn

This guide teaches **domain experts with zero coding background** how to build and ship real web applications using AI tools like Claude and Cursor.

By the end, you'll be able to build:
- ✅ Web apps with user accounts and authentication
- ✅ Database-driven applications that store and retrieve data
- ✅ Payment-integrated products with Stripe
- ✅ Deployed applications with real URLs that anyone can access

**No prior programming experience needed.** If you can clearly describe what you want to build, AI can help you build it.

## Who This Is For

### Perfect for:
- 🎯 Domain experts with product ideas but no technical background
- 🧑‍🏫 Teachers, marketers, consultants, designers, creators who see problems software could solve
- 💼 Professionals who tried learning to code and bounced off the syntax
- 🚀 Entrepreneurs who can't afford $50k for an MVP but have valuable product ideas

### Not required:
- ❌ Computer science degree
- ❌ Previous programming experience
- ❌ Understanding of how computers work
- ❌ Math skills beyond basic arithmetic

## What Makes This Different

Traditional coding courses teach you syntax, algorithms, and computer science theory. This guide teaches you **how to build products** by describing what you want while AI handles the implementation.

**Key insight:** The bottleneck isn't writing code anymore — it's knowing what to build and how to describe it clearly. That's where your domain expertise becomes your superpower.

## Guide Contents

### [Chapter 1: The Vibe Coding Method](chapters/01-introduction)
Why AI changes everything, who this is for, and what you'll be able to build. Includes real success stories from non-technical builders.

### [Chapter 2: Understanding the Shape of Apps](chapters/02-understanding-apps)
Just enough mental models to direct AI effectively. Learn to think in shapes and flows, not code and syntax. Includes visual diagrams.

### [Chapter 3: Choosing Your Stack](chapters/03-choosing-stack)
Clear, opinionated recommendations for tools and technologies. No endless research — practical choices that work. Includes decision tree and pricing guide.

### [Chapter 4: Your First AI-Built App in One Hour](chapters/04-tutorial)
Learn the ONE PROMPT method. Build a real bookmark manager by describing what you want, not following 28 steps. Deploy it live in 60 minutes.

### [Chapter 5: Common Building Blocks](chapters/05-building-blocks)
Reference guide for typical features: authentication, databases, file uploads, payments, email, deployment. Each with example prompts.

### [Chapter 6: When Things Break](chapters/06-debugging)
Debugging through conversation, not through code. How to read error messages and work with AI to fix issues.

### [Chapter 7: How to Know It Actually Works](chapters/07-testing)
Simple testing strategies for non-technical builders. Catch obvious problems before users do, without writing unit tests.

### [Chapter 8: What's Next](chapters/08-whats-next)
Graduating to more complex builds, joining the community, and accessing advanced resources.
