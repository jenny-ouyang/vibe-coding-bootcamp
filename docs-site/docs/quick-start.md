## Your Two Choices Right Now

### Choice 1: Review What I Made ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**What to do:**
1. Read Chapter 1 (`01-introduction.md`)
2. Read the README (`README.md`)
3. Tell me:
   - Does this match your voice?
   - Any sections to change?
   - Should I continue with Chapters 2-7?

**Time needed:** 15-20 minutes to review

**Why this matters:** If I nail the voice and structure now, the next 6 chapters will flow perfectly.

---

### Choice 2: Let Me Keep Building

**What I'll do next:**
1. Build Chapter 2: Understanding the Shape of Apps (~9 pages)
2. Build Chapter 3: Choosing Your Stack (~11 pages)  
3. Start Chapter 4: First Build Tutorial (~13 pages)
4. Show you all three together

**Time to create:** 1-2 hours for me to write

**Why you might choose this:** See more content before giving feedback, batch review.

## What Makes This Work (The Strategy)

### Why Two Platforms

**GitHub = Discovery**
- Free forever, public
- Google indexes it (SEO traffic)
- Developers star/share it
- Builds credibility

**Gumroad = Email Capture**  
- Pay-what-you-want at $0
- Gets emails when people download
- Professional PDF format
- Can send follow-up sequences

**Both point to:** Your newsletter

### Why This Structure Works

**Problem with most coding tutorials:**
- Start with syntax
- Abstract concepts first
- Build toy examples
- Never ship anything real

**This guide:**
- Starts with philosophy (why you can do this)
- Mental models (how to think about it)
- Real project (build something that works)
- Reference guide (lookup as needed)
- Deploy live (ship something real)

**Result:** Non-technical people ship products in 7 days.

## What You Need to Decide

### Decision 1: Voice & Direction
Does Chapter 1 feel like you? Is this the right approach?

### Decision 2: Continue Now or Wait
Should I build Chapters 2-7 now, or do you want to workshop Chapter 1 first?

### Decision 3: Launch Date
When do you want this live? Working backwards from that date helps us pace.

### Decision 4: Notion Content
Are there other pages in your AI Library I should fetch and include?

---

## How to Give Feedback

### Format that helps me:
✅ "Chapter 1, paragraph 3 - rewrite this to be more direct"
✅ "Add a story about [specific thing]"
✅ "This section feels too technical, simplify"
✅ "Love this, keep going in this direction"

### Less helpful:
❌ "Needs work" (what specifically?)
❌ "Not quite right" (which part?)
❌ "Make it better" (in what way?)

**Best:** Tell me what you want changed and I'll fix it immediately.

## My Recommendation

**Best next step:**

1. **Read Chapter 1** (01-introduction.md) - 5 minutes
2. **Scan the README** (README.md) - 2 minutes  
3. **Tell me:** "Looks good, keep building" OR "Change X, Y, Z first"
4. **I'll continue** to Chapters 2-7 based on your feedback

This gets us momentum while ensuring I'm building in the right direction.

## Questions I Have for You
